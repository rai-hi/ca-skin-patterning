# Cellular Automata Skin Patterning simulation
Dissertation project on using Cellular Automata to simulate the development of skin patterning

The repository includes both the PDF of the dissertation, as well as the software developed as part of it. The source code is bundled with the application.

It is my intention to recreate the software using a more accessible language - until then, it requires Matlab to run.

Note: The Matlab runtime installer (MCRInstaller.exe) is not included. You can download it from [here](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html) and place it in the `SkinSim` directory with the other `.exe` files.
