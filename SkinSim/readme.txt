If Matlab is not installed on the target machine, the Matlab Compiler Runtime must be installed first. This can be found in the program folder of Matlab, or alternatively I have hosted it publicly at http://db.tt/LtilHmhj (Dropbox).

To execute the program, simply launch SkinSim.exe. Whichever folder SkinSim is run from must also contain 'Images' and 'Initial Conditions' folders.

If for any reason you cannot launch the executable file, open Matlab and change the current folder to SkinSim/Source Code/Stage 3 Final implementation/. Enter 'young_gui_2' into the Matlab command line and the program will launch.
